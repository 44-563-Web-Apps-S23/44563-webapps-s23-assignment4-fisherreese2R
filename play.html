        <h1>Fisher Reese snips a play</h1>
        <h2>Tradition by George Middleton </h2>

        <h6>MARY.</h6> <p>Yes. That's right, father; I _had_ to.</p>
        <h6>OLLIVANT.</h6><p>[_He stops smoking and looks at her sharply._]</p> <p>Had to? Who made you?</p>
        <h6>MARY.</h6><p>[_Reluctantly._]</p> <p>It was something inside me.</p>
        <h6>OLLIVANT.</h6><p>[_In spite of himself._]</p> <p>Tush--that foolishness.</p>
        <h6>MARY.</h6><p>[_Quickly._]</p> <p>Don't make it hard for us again.</p>
        <h6>OLLIVANT.</h6><p>I made it hard, Mary? Because I objected to you leaving your mother here alone?</p>
        <h6>MARY.</h6> <p>I remember; you said I was a foolish, "stage-struck" girl.</p>
        <h6>OLLIVANT.</h6><p>Well, you're over _that_, aren't you?</p>
