                MARY. Yes. That's right, father; I _had_ to.<br>

                OLLIVANT. [_He stops smoking and looks at her sharply._] Had to? Who<br>
                made you?<br>

                MARY. [_Reluctantly._] It   was something inside me.<br>

                OLLIVANT. [_In spite of himself._] Tush--that foolishness.<br>

                MARY. [_Quickly._] Don't make it hard for us again.<br>

                OLLIVANT. I made it hard, Mary? Because I objected to your leaving your<br>
                mother here alone?<br>

                MARY. I remember; you said I was a foolish, "stage-struck" girl.<br>

                OLLIVANT. Well, you're over _that_, aren't you?<br>
